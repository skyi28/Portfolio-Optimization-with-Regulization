<p style='text-align: justify'>This project aims to optimize a portfolio using the minimum variance portfolio, while incorporating regularization techniques. The regularization method used is L1 (Lasso) regression, which promotes sparsity by adding a penalty term to the loss function. The code is based on the paper <a href='https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp936.pdf'>Sparse and stable Markowitz portfolios</a> published by Joshua Bordie, Ingrid Daubechies, Christine De Mol, Domenico Giannone and Ignace Loris.</p>
