This paper empirically assesses the stabilization of minimum variance and maximum Sharpe ratio Markowitz portfolios caused by regularization, given their widely noted vulnerability to input estimation errors. Using rolling-window backtests of daily industry portfolio returns (2000â€“2024), we demonstrate that both L1 and L2 regularization improve portfolio weight stability. For minimum variance portfolios, moderate penalization slightly improves risk measures, whereas overly aggressive shrinkage is counterproductive. On the other hand, max Sharpe ratio portfolios are helped significantly by added regularization, in particular L1, and are seen to enhance Sharpe ratios and reduce risk by inducing sparsity and mitigating overfitting intrinsic in unpenalized estimates. L2 effects are analogous but weaker. The results suggest that although robustness is enhanced through regularization, its most suitable application is strategy-dependent with type and strength requiring careful calibration to the portfolio goal.
